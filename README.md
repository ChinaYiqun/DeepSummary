## I. Project Introduction
Are you still struggling with organizing and summarizing a vast amount of information? Do you long for an efficient and convenient tool that can quickly distill complex information into valuable content? Ultra - Simplified DeepSummary is the magical tool designed to solve these problems! üöÄ

This project mainly consists of several core files, including `tool.py`, `deepsearch_tst.py`, `deepsearch_obo.py`, and `deepsearch_rea.py`. By integrating advanced techniques such as OpenAI API and Bing search, it can help users quickly conduct in - depth information mining and generate high - quality summary reports.

## II. Highlights of Core Functions

### 1. Intelligent Task Decomposition (TaskAgent)
- Utilize the advanced OpenAI API to instantly decompose complex user requests into multiple independent sub - queries. Just like a super - intelligent assistant, it precisely grasps user needs and points the way for subsequent information searches. üåü
- Example: Input "Research progress of new - energy batteries", and the system can quickly break it down into multiple targeted sub - questions, greatly improving the efficiency of information search.

### 2. Content Generation and Expansion
- **Outline Generation**: Based on the user's request, generate a 3 - level logical and coherent outline that covers the core issues.
- **Content Filling**: Fill in the core content according to the outline, including key data and cases.
- **Content Validation and Expansion**: Call the search engine to verify the key data in the content, correct errors, and supplement the latest cases.

### 3. ReAct - Based Research Process
- The `ReActResearcher` class uses a reflection - action mechanism. It can generate specific executable instructions according to the current state, such as search verification, content expansion, and outline reconstruction.
- The main loop continuously reflects and takes actions until the research is completed, gradually enriching the research content.

### 4. Efficient Content Summarization (SummaryAgent)
- Organize and re - format all the polished content to generate a high - quality summary report. The report is not only rich in content and well - organized but also includes all reference links at the end of the text for users to further consult. üìÑ
- Support saving the summary report as a Markdown file and automatically optimize the titles in the file to make it more readable and professional.

## III. File Introduction
- **`tool.py`**: Contains some utility functions, such as calling the OpenAI API, getting Bing search results, web crawling, and cleaning strings.
- **`deepsearch_tst.py`**: Implements the overall process of information summarization, including task decomposition, web information retrieval, content polishing, and summary report generation.
- **`deepsearch_obo.py`**: Follows a step - by - step process to generate a report, including outline generation, content filling, validation, and report structuring.
- **`deepsearch_rea.py`**: Implements a research process based on the ReAct mechanism, including reflection, action, and final report generation.

## IV. Usage Example
The following is a simple usage example showing how to call the `deepsearch` function for information summarization:
```python
from deepsearch_tst import deepsearch

# User request
user_request = "Research progress of new - energy batteries"

# Call the deepsearch function to generate a summary report
result = deepsearch(user_request)
```
After running the above code, the system will automatically create a folder named after the user request and generate multiple Markdown files in this folder, including the polished content of each sub - query and the final summary report `result.md`.

## V. Precautions
- Before using this project, please ensure that you have correctly configured the `config.py` file, including relevant information about Azure OpenAI and the subscription key for Bing search. ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Since it involves network requests and API calls, it may be affected by network conditions and API usage limits. Please ensure a stable network connection and use API resources reasonably.

Come and experience the charm of Ultra - Simplified DeepSummary! Let information processing no longer be cumbersome and start a new chapter of efficient information mining! üéâ
